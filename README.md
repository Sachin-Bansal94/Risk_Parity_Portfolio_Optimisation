Implemented a risk parity portfolio optimization model to achieve equal risk contribution from all assets within the portfolio.
Analytically solved for a risk Parity portfolio-each asset contributing equal risk to ensure true diversification or risk. 

Defined the numerical optimization problem having equality and inequality constraints

Solved the optimization problem using SQP and implemented in python and then compared the weight from Minimum Variance and Maximum SharpeÂ Portfolio
